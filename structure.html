  <h1>HTML Fundamentals: Structure</h1>
    <p>When it comes to HTML, we want to know how to structure our page. This is very important because we want to be able to have a neat and beautiful page while also maintaining proper content and placing it in the proper place. It also helps with screen readers and other people who have disabilities.</p>
    <h2>
      &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong>What it does:</strong><br>
      This is the first thing that comes before the &lt;html&gt; tag. It tells the browser what version of HTML we are using. In this case, we are using HTML5.
    </p>

    <h2>
      &lt;html&gt;
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong>What it does:</strong><br>
      This is the first thing that comes after the &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt; tag. This is the root element of an HTML page. All other elements <u>MUST</u> be descendants of this element.
      
      <h2>
        &lt;head&gt;
      </h2>
    <p>
      <strong>What it does:</strong><br>
      This is the first thing that comes after the &lt;html&gt; tag. This element contains all the metadata (machine-readable information) about the page. This includes the title, the scripts/style sheets, and keywords that will help with the SEO (Search Engine Optimization).
    </p>

    <h2>
      &lt;title&gt;
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong>What it does:</strong><br>
      This element is the broswer's title or the page's tab. It only contains text and all tags with within the element will be ignored.
    </p>

    <h2>
      &lt;body&gt;
    </h2>
    <p>
      <strong>What it does:</strong>
      This elements contains <u>ALL</u> the content you wish to display on the web broswer. There can only be one &lt;body&gt; element per page. Again, everything you want the user to see goes here.
    </p>
