    <h1>HTML Fundamentals: Elements</h1>
    <p>HTML is comprised of elements, if we use these elements in a proper combination we can make an awesome website! but how do elements work and what exactly are they?</p>
    
    <h2>What are elements?</h2>
    <>
      All elements have an opening and closing tag. The opening tag has the name of the element inside it and if they are <u>NOT</u> self closing then there is a closing tag with a slash before the name.<br>
      <strong><i>EXAMPLE:</i></strong><br>
      <ul>
        <li>Opening Tag &#8594; &lt;p&gt;<br></li>
        This opening tag displays a less than symbol, element name (In this example it is p for paragraph), and a greater than symbol. This completes the opening tag and will continue to put everything into a paragraph until you close it.
        <li>Closing Tag &#8594; &lt;/p&gt;<br></li>
        The closing tag looks the same as the opening tag but NOTICE that the closing tag has a <u>SLASH</u> This completes the closing tag and will contain everything you wrote before it into the element. 
      </ul>
      
        Keep in mind that ALL elements close. Even if they are self closing tags. They will looks something like this &#8594; &lt;img /&gt; Notice the slash is AT THE END of the element before the greater than symbol.
