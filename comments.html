  <h1>HTML Fundamentals: Comments</h1>
  <h2>&lt;!-- HTML Comments --&gt;</h2>
  <p>
    <strong>What it does:</strong><br>
    HTML comments are <u>NOT</u> displayed in the browser. They are used to help document your code and explain what it does or perhaps what you did. I like to say comments explain code to the programmer and code explains comments to the computer. To write an HTML comment, you need to write it out just like the title. It goes as follows: &lt;!-- Add your comment here --&gt;
  </p>

  <h2>&lt;!--Multi-Line <br>
    comment--&gt;</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>What it does:</strong><br>
      You can add multiple lines of text inside a multi-line comment. What's the difference you ask? <strong>NOTHING.</strong> As long as your comment is between this &#8594; &lt;!-- ... --&gt;, it will be commented. Easy right? I hope so!
